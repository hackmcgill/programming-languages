Python aims to be simple, and to come "batteries included". Indeed, the Python
standard library comes built in with many useful modules, e.g. for sending
email and unit testing. A wealth of powerful third party libraries and
frameworks exist for Python, and it is used for various tasks ranging from
backend web development (with Django, Flask, SQLAlchemy) to scientific
programming (with NumPy, SciPy, Scikit, Matplotlib). Due to its simplicity,
Python is also used as a general purpose system scripting language, sometimes
as a replacement for bash.
