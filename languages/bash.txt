Bash is at once a programming language and an environment for manipulating
Unix-like operating systems. It is the glue in the Unix philosophy of
modularity: many small, single-purpose programs can be strung together easily
with Bash in order to achieve more complex behaviours. Bash scripts have
traditionally been used for simple systems administration tasks, but they can
generally be used to make operating Unix-like systems easier and more
efficient. They are not typically used for general purpose programming.
