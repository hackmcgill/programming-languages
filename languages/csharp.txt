Originally, C# was simply "Microsoft's version of Java". Both languages had
strikingly similar features as well as syntax. Recently, C# has become much
more. It has increasingly been acquiring features making it arguably more
enjoyable to use, decreasing development times. C# is used a lot in desktop
application development as well as in server development, much like Java. Also,
C# is used in indie to medium size game development due to the XNA framework
and to the Unity game engine's decision to use C# as one of its scripting
languages.
