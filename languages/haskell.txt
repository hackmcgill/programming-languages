Haskell uses higher mathematical concepts to model computations. A powerful
type system at its core makes it difficult if not impossible to write incorrect
programs. A common saying in Haskell is "if it compiles, then it works".
The type system also allows for much more powerful resusable abstractions than other languages.
Haskell is widely used in industry, notably at Google, Facebook, and Microsoft; it is also used by programming language researchers in academia.
