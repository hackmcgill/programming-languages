JavaScript is a language originally conceived in 1995 to make the web a little
bit more interesting, by adding animations and interactivity to the otherwise
plain web pages of that time. Nowadays, JavaScript is everywhere: web
development, server development, mobile development, you name it. Despite the
similarity of their names, Java and JavaScript have essentially nothing in
common besides the glancing likeness of their syntaxes. The core language of
JavaScript is quite simple, but the surrounding ecosystem can be difficult to
get a handle on, which can make it tricky to use in applications outside of
frontend web development.
