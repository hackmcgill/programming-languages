C++ is a higher level version of C, and it includes many modern language
features such as object oriented programming. In fact, C++ has so many features
that it's hard to learn to learn them all! Being a very close descendant of C,
C++ remains very performant, and thanks to its additional features can be used
to program more abstractly. As a result, C++ is used a lot in professional
video game development.
