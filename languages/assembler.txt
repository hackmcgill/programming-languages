Assembly languages are processor-specific machines codes that can be executed
directly by the processor. Hardly anybody writes programs in these by hand, but
it can be useful to know assembly to do binary reverse engineering (to give
yourself unlimited health in certain games, for example) or to simply have a
deeper understanding of what's going on under the hood of the programs written
in C or high level languages.
