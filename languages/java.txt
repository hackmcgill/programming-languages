Java is the king of enterprise languages, finding use in very large scale
applications such as distributed systems. The essential benefit of Java over
other industry-standard languages is that Java source code is compiled to an
intermediate representation called bytecode. This bytecode can be run on any
platform that supports the Java Virtual Machine. In practice, that means
basically every operating system and processor architecture. Java is used a lot
in desktop application development and in custom server development such as the
multiplayer servers for certain video games. Java is also the main development
language for Android.
