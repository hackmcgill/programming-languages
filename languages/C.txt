In contrast to the languages above, C is a low-level language. Practically,
this means that the code is write is almost running directly "on the metal" of
the computer, and as a programmer, you have to concern yourself with such
things as allocating memory for your data structures. On the one hand, this
makes C arguably more difficult to use that the higher level languages we've
discussed. On the other hand, C programs tend to be tremendously more
efficient. For mission-critical applications, operating systems development,
and development for embedded systems such as robotics and specialty hardware
used in need medecine and aerospace, C is frequently the only option.
